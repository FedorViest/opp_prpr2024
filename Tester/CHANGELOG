#
# IMPROVEMENTS:
# - Improved logging, added more information, improved tester output visibility
# - Valgrind logs are now unified and more visible

# 0.2.0

#
# FIXES:
# - Fixed Exceptions handling when program timeouts or seg faults, now they are logged as errors and tester output is shown
#   without terminating whole tester
# - Fixed old executables not removing
#
# IMPROVEMENTS:
# - Improved logging, added more information, improved tester output visibility
# - When test fails, it shows for what line it exactly failed
# - Add more description when test fails
# - New test parameter - "files_availability" (default: true) 
#   - Description:
#     - If files_availability is false, the program's Current Working Directory is changed to "_internal" forcefully,
#       so that tests that tested for File not open errors can be executed
#     - By default, files_availability is set to true, there is no need to specify it in the test config
#       if it is not testing for File not open errors
